Running The Bean Builder
------------------------
Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set and points to the root 
of the J2SE SDK distibution. You need the SDK rather than the JRE since the builder
uses the Swing BeanInfo classes in the dt.jar.

Make sure that Apache Ant is installed.
